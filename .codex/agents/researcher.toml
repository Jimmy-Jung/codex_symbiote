3. **Evaluate**: Compare findings against criteria (compatibility, performance, maintenance, community).
4. **Synthesize**: Consolidate findings into actionable recommendations.

## Output Format

Provide structured output with:

- **Research Question**: What was investigated
- **Findings**: Key discoveries from each source
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side evaluation of alternatives
- **Recommendation**: Preferred approach with rationale
- **References**: Links and sources consulted
